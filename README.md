Machine Learning Predictive Models
This repository contains implementations of multiple machine learning models applied to various datasets. Each model has been evaluated using performance metrics like accuracy and confusion matrices, and the results are stored in the results folder.

Datasets
The following datasets have been used in this project:

Iris Dataset: A classification dataset for predicting the species of Iris flowers.
Breast Cancer Dataset: A classification dataset for identifying malignant vs. benign tumors.
Wine Dataset: A classification dataset for predicting wine quality based on chemical composition.
Digits Dataset: A multi-class classification dataset for handwritten digit recognition (0-9).
Models
The following machine learning models were applied to each dataset:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
For each model, we trained, evaluated, and plotted confusion matrices to visualize performance. You can find the output plots in the results folder.

How It Works
1. Preprocessing
Each dataset is preprocessed by normalizing the features and handling any missing values.
2. Model Training
The models are trained on 70% of the data, and the remaining 30% is used for testing.
We also applied GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning of the KNN model on the Breast Cancer dataset.
3. Evaluation
Each model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, classification report (precision, recall, F1-score), and confusion matrices.
The confusion matrices for each model and dataset are stored in the results folder.
4. Visualization
Confusion matrices for each model and dataset are generated using seaborn.heatmap() for better visualization.
Results
Here are some example results:

Iris Dataset: Logistic Regression achieved an accuracy of X%, while Random Forest performed slightly better with X%.
Breast Cancer Dataset: The Decision Tree had an accuracy of X%, but after hyperparameter tuning, KNN provided the best results.
Wine Dataset: Random Forest outperformed the other models with X% accuracy.

Future Work
Adding more sophisticated models like SVM, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.
Deploying models using Streamlit for interactive predictions on new data.
